# Configuration file to define the IoT Edge devices and IIOT assets to deploy over a ISA-95 network in Azure
# 
# How to use:
# - Do not modify the network layers (subnets) names as they must map to the ISA-95 network
# - For each network layer, specify a list of IoT Edge devices or IIOT assets to certificates separated by white spaces
# - Each IoT Edge device or IIOT asset will run in an Azure VM
# - IIOT assets are differianted by IoT Edge devices by the value in parenthesis after their names:
#     - If set to OPC-UA or OPC-UA-1, an OPC-UA server is simulated with configuration 1. Ex: L2-OPC-UA-server-1(OPC-UA)
#     - If set to OPC-UA-2, an OPC-UA server is simulated with configuration 2. L2-OPC-UA-server-2(OPC-UA-2)
#     - For every other value or no value between parenthesis, an IoT Edge device is created
# - IoT Edge devices' parents are provided by the value in parenthesis after their names. Ex: L4-edge(L5-edge) creates an IoT Edge device named L4-edge which parent is L5-edge
# - IoT Edge devices without parents are connected directly to the cloud. Ex: L5-edge connects directly to the cloud
# - Only give names to IoT Edge devices or IIOT assets that meet the Linux Azure VMs naming standards, e.g.
#     - Their names cannot exceed 64 characters in length
#     - Their names cannot contain the following characters: ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) = + _ [ ] { } \\ | ; : ' \" , < > / ?."
# - IoT Edge configuration
#     - BaseDeploymentFilePath: Pointer to a JSON deployment manifest file that will be used as a base for all IoT Edge devices
#     - RootCA: Pointer to a tar file with Root CA and Azure IoT tooling to generate TLS server certificates for all IoT Edge devices
# - Case matters and make sure to keep an empty line at the end of the file
