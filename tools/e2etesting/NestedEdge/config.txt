# Configuration file to define the IoT Edge devices and IIOT assets to deploy over a Purdue network in Azure
#
# How to use:
# - Network layers (subnets) of the Purdue Network are fixed.
# - In each network layer, you can specify a list of IoT Edge devices or IIOT assets to deploy. Separate them by white spaces. For example, L5-edge-1 L5-edge-2.
# - Each IoT Edge device or IIOT asset will run in an Azure VM.
# - IoT Edge devices' parents are specified in parenthesis. Ex: L4-edge(L5-edge) creates an IoT Edge device named L4-edge which has L5-edge device has a parent.
# - IoT Edge devices without parents are connected directly to the cloud. They should be in L5. Ex: L5-edge connects directly to the cloud.
# - IIOT assets (e.g. simulated OPC UA servers) have their name followed by "(OPC-UA)". For example, L2-OPC-UA-server(OPC-UA. Thus don't name one of your IoT Edge device "OPC-UA".
# - Only give names to IoT Edge devices or IIOT assets that meet the Linux Azure VMs naming standards, e.g.
#     - Their names cannot exceed 64 characters in length
#     - Their names cannot contain the following characters: ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) = + _ [ ] { } \\ | ; : ' \" , < > / ?."
# - RootCA value currently cannot be changed.
# - Case matters and make sure to keep an empty line at the end of the file.
