# Azure Industrial IoT Components

### Discover, register and manage your Industrial Assets in Azure

OPC Twin allows plant operators to discover OPC UA servers in a factory network and register them in Azure IoT Hub.  

### Analyze, react to events, and control equipment from anywhere

OPC Twin allows operations personnel to subscribe to and react to events on the factory floor from anywhere in the world. The Microservices' REST APIs mirror the OPC UA services edge-side and are secured using OAUTH authentication and authorization backed by Azure Active Directory (AAD).  This enables your cloud applications to browse server address spaces or read/write variables and execute methods using HTTPS and simple OPC UA JSON payloads.  

### Provision certificates and trust groups

OPC Vault enables OT and IT to manage OPC UA Application Certificates and Trust Lists.  Certificates secure client to server communication. Trust Lists determine which client is allowed to talk to which server.  Certificates and private keys can be issued and continuously renewed to keep your OPC UA server endpoints secure.  OPC Vault  is built on Azure Key Vault which guards your private keys in a secure hardware location.

### Simple developer experience

The [REST API](docs/api/readme.md) can be used with any programming language through its exposed Open API specification (Swagger). This means when integrating OPC UA into cloud management solutions, developers are free to choose technology that matches their skills, interests, and architecture choices.  For example, a full stack web developer who develops an application for an alarm and event dashboard can write logic to respond to events in JavaScript or TypeScript without ramping up on a OPC UA SDK, C, C++, Java or C#.

## Components

The repository (azure-iiot-components) includes all Azure Industrial IoT component repositories as its submodules which are:

-  [Micro services](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iiot-services)
   - [OPC  Twin](docs/twin/readme.md) Microservices provide discovery, registration, and remote control of industrial devices through REST APIs.  
   - [OPC Vault](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iiot-opc-vault-service) Microservices enable secure communication among OPC UA enabled devices and the cloud. 
- [API](docs/api/readme.md)
-  IoT Edge modules
  - [OPC Twin module](docs/twin/module/module.md)
  - [OPC Publisher module](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-opc-publisher)
- Components and protocol stacks including
  - [OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iiot-opc-ua)
