# Run / Debug Azure Industrial IoT locally

[Home](readme.md)

The Industrial IoT Microservices contained in this repository provide a REST like API exposing the Industrial IoT Platform capabilities.  This article explains how to build, run and debug these services on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have deployed the Azure Platform dependencies for all Microservices in this repository and retrieved the resulting `.env` file.  If you have not, please follow the instructions [how to deploy Azure services only](howto-deploy-local.md)

If you have not done so yet, clone this GitHub repository.  To clone the repository you need git.  If you do not have git installed on your system, follow the instructions for [Linux or Mac](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), or [Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to install it.  

To clone the repository, open a command prompt or terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/Industrial-IoT
cd Industrial-IoT
```

## Build and run the Industrial IoT Microservices with Visual Studio or VS Code

1. First, make sure your development tool chain is setup to build the Microservices. If you have not, [install .NET Core 3.1+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) and
   - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).  On Windows Visual Studio 2019 16.4+ or on Mac [Visual Studio for MacOS](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) 8.3+.
   - Or latest version [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Ensure you have the [C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)][omnisharp-url] extension installed.
2. Ensure that the `.env` file previously generated by the deployment script is located in the repository root.
3. Open the `Industrial-IoT.sln` solution file in Visual Studio or VS Code
4. Right click on the solution in the solution viewer and select `Properties`.
5. Set the start up project to be  `Microsoft.Azure.IIoT.Services.All`.
6. Log into Azure using the Az CLI (az login) or Visual Studio using the credential used to deploy the infrastructure.  See [here](Authenticating-to-Keyvault) for more information and troubleshooting.
7. Start debugging by pressing the "Start" button or hitting F5.
8. [Ensure the Microservices are running](#ensure-the-microservices-are-running)

> Installing [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-141975.SwitchStartupProject) you can start an entire environment containing Edge modules, command line interface, engineering sample application and services from within Visual Studio 2019.  Just select the the "Local development" startup configuration in the top left corner drop down in the IDE.   Use the "no services" configuration if you want to start only the edge environment and applications.

## Ensure the Microservices are running

After starting open a browser window to:

- http://localhost:9080/registry/swagger for OPC Registry Microservice
- http://localhost:9080/twin/swagger for OPC UA Server Twin Microservice
- http://localhost:9080/history/swagger for OPC UA Historic Access Microservice
- http://localhost:9080/publisher/swagger for the OPC Publisher service

which will show you the each Microservice's swagger UI. If the services exit immediately after start, check that the `.env` file exists in the root of the repository.  

## Authenticating to Keyvault

All configuration is stored in Azure KeyVault during deployment.  KeyVault also is used to provide scale out data protection.  When running inside Azure Cloud the platform uses a Managed Service Identity to access KeyVault and pull this information in a secure way.   When you run outside of Azure you need to log in using Az to log in or Visual Studio Service Authentication (Tools->Options->Azure Service Authentication).  

Double check the following if you encounter any KeyVault access issues during startup.

- If you deployed yourself, make sure that inside the deployed KeyVault resource your user principal has Key and Secret access rights.  

- If you did not or you do not see your principal configured in KeyVault, add your identity and give it all Key and Secret management rights.

- Sometimes your token has expired.  Re-add your account in Visual Studio, or use az login to log in again.

## Next steps

- Develop an Application that reads and writes Variables in an OPC UA Server (COMING SOON)
