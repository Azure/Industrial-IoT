   * Create the alert rule using the following query:

     ```text
     SecurityIoTRawEvent
     | where RawEventName == 'ConfigurationError' and parse_json(EventDetails)['ErrorType'] == 'NotOptimal'
     | extend AccountCustomEntity = EventDetails
     ```

   * And you're done! Next time an alert is raised matching the alert rule, a case is created which you can check on Cases. You could also go to Logs section to check logs in certain time period
