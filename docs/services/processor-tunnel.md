# Http Tunnel Processor and Forwarder

[Home](readme.md)

## Overview

The Http Tunnel processor processes Http Tunnelling requests from edge modules and dispatches them to arbitrary Web Servers.   This functionality allows tunneling REST calls from the edge through Edge Hub and thus a single key hole to to Azure.  It provides the reverse of Azure IoT Hub Device Methods.
