## Azure Industrial IoT OPC Publisher 2.9.4

We are pleased to announce the release of version 2.9.4 of OPC Publisher and the companion web api service. This release comes with several bug and security fixes and is the latest supported release.

### Breaking changes in 2.9.4

> IMPORTANT. Please read when updating from previous versions of OPC Publisher

- Arm64 and AMD64 container images are published now with Mariner (Azure) Linux (distroless) as base images instead of Alpine.
- Arm32 (v7) images of OPC Publisher continue to use Alpine as base image. Support transitions to the same model as for "preview" features.  Security updates are released as a result of updates to the AMD64 and ARM64 version of OPC Publisher.

### Changes in 2.9.4

- Send the error of CreateMonitoredItem as part of the keyframe field and in heartbeats if WatchdogLKV heartbeat behavior is used (#2150).
- Credential based authentication uses concrete types for credentials now which are documented in openapi.json (#2152)
- OPC Publisher can now obtain TLS certificates from IoT Edge workload API to secure the HTTPS API (#2101)
- Fix release build issue which broke support for ARM64 images running on RPi4 (#2145).
- Update console diagnostics output to provide better naming, additional diagnostics and reflect other transports than IoT Edge Hub (#2141)
- Add keep alive notification counts to Diagnostics output and messages
- Add a full version that includes runtime, framework and full version string to runtime state message, twin, diagnostic object, and in console output.
- When only using cyclic reads, the underlying dummy subscription should stay disabled (#2139)
- Recreate session if it expires on server (#2138)
- Log subscription keep alive error only when session is connected (#2137)
- Update OPC UA .net stack to latest version (1.4.372.116-preview) to enable fully async reconnect and fix several issues in previous versions.
- Added the ability to switch publisher to emit logs in syslog or systemd format using --lfm command line option.
- Fix issue where certain publish errors cause reconnect state machine to fail (#2104, #2136)

## Azure Industrial IoT OPC Publisher 2.9.3

We are pleased to announce the release of version 2.9.3 of OPC Publisher and the companion web api. This release moves OPC Publisher to .net 8 which is the latest LTS version of .net and comes with several new features, bug and security fixes. 2.9.3 is the latest supported release.

### Breaking changes in 2.9.3

> IMPORTANT. Please read when updating from previous versions of OPC Publisher

- Arm64 and AMD64 container images are published now with (Azure) Mariner Linux (distroless) as base images instead of Alpine.
- Arm32 (v7) images of OPC Publisher continue to use Alpine as base image. Support transitions to the same model as for "preview" features.  Security updates are released as a result of updates to the AMD64 and ARM64 version of OPC Publisher.
- Metadata collection has shown to be very taxing on OPC UA servers. When 2.9 was dropped in to replace 2.8 in production, memory consumption was too large and connections would drop. OPC Publisher now defaults to `--dm=true` in 2.9.3 to disable metadata messages to be compatible with 2.8 when `--strict` / `-c` is not specified. If you need meta data messages but do not use strict mode (not recommended) you must explicitly enable it using `--dm=false`.

### New features in 2.9.3

- For security the OPC Publisher Web API container now runs root-less. (#2114)
- New configuration option to specify quality of service. This allows setting QOS0 as alternative to QOS1 (#2085)
- Diagnostic info can now also be periodically published to a topic or IoT Edge output name using new `--dtt` diagnostics topic template. (#2068)
- New Module to module method to get REST endpoint info and API key so that other modules can access the REST API (#2096)
- Fixed Publisher HTTPS API returning SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL error. Now a self signed certificate is the fallback if workload api cannot produce a certificate with private key (#2101)
- Restart announcement now includes additional information, including version, timestamp of (re-)start, module and device ids.
- X509 User Authentication support using secrets reference feature request (#2005)
- New API to manage the PKI infrastructure of the OPC Publisher (certificate stores). You can now list, add and remove certificates from the OPC UA certificate stores remotely. (#1996)
- You can now configure OPC Publisher to re-use a session across writer groups with the same endpoint url and security settings. (#2065)
- Subscription Watchdog monitors keep alive notifications and generates metric and logs when subscription keep alive is missing (#2060)
- Added samples to show how to call OPC Publisher API over MQTT, HTTP and IoT Hub.

### Bug fixes in 2.9.3

- 2.8 Start instrument was missing on 2.9 prometheus endpoint (#2110)
- Fix Publisher cannot get ssl cert from workload api, HTTPS API returning SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL error (#2101)
- Harden when OPC UA server sometimes reports monitored items samples changes unordered in subscription notification and thus samples messages are also unordered (#2108)
- Need to have timestamp information and other information in runtime state reporting message, need to have a special routing path for runtime state messages feature request. Restart announcement now includes additional information, including version, timestamp of (re-)start, module and device ids. (#2111)
- Optimize metadata collection, do not collect metadata from servers for built in types (#2105)
- Fix that it was not possible to configure event subscriptions for multiple events on the same node id (#2098)
- Fix complex type encoding where Json message encoding has value in Binary encoding for complex (multilevel structure) (#2090)
- Dapr now works without requiring state component. Dapr now runs over http instead of https by default. New option to select the url scheme (#2102, #2119, #2117, #2109
- It is now possible to disable retrying subscription re-creation by configuring a value of 0. (#2100)
- Fix that extension field values show up wrong in samples mode. (#2092)
- Fix Event subscription using the REST Api fails with: "The request field is required." (#2078)
- The configuration of the OpcPublisher 2.9.2 fails using the REST Api bug (#2066)
- For each configured in pn.json Dataset publisher must try to reuse an existing session for this EndpointUrl with the identical security settings (if exists). feature request
- Address issues deploying the web api, e.g., getting error when trying to use option 2 to deploy Azure IIoT Deployment and ./aad-register.ps1 errors with "A parameter cannot be found that matches the parameter name 'ReplyUrl'." (#2063, #2064)
- Update documentation, including breaking changes, Add Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault services, and Application Insights to arch diagram, how to setup the OPCPublisher edge module with X.509 certificates documentation, and how to emit ExtensionFields in Pub sub mode using key frame counter. (#1917, #2091, #2083)
- Fix incorrect API definitions in OpenAPI JSON for OPC publisher
- FileSystem target now appends data instead of updating the file content. FileSystem target now supports arbitrary chars in topics.

### IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ

- IoT Edge 1.1 LTS will be going out of support on 12/13/2022, please [update your IoT Edge gateways to IoT Edge 1.4 LTS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-update-iot-edge).

  > To continue deploying the 1.1 LTS modules to your environment follow [these instructions](./opc-publisher/readme.md#getting-started).

- Windows container images are no longer supported in IoT Edge 1.4 and consequentially have been removed from this release. Please use [IoT Edge for Linux on Windows (EFLOW) 1.4](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/azure-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows) as your IoT Edge environment on Windows.  

  > IoT Edge 1.4 LTS EFLOW is supported as a Preview Feature in this release.

  - You must update your Windows based IoT Edge environment to EFLOW **ahead of deploying the platform**.  
  - Simulation deployed as part of the ./deploy.ps1 script now deploys EFLOW on a Windows VM Host (Preview Feature).  This requires nested virtualization.  The Azure subscription and chosen region must support Standard_D4_v4 VM which supports nested virtualization or deployment of simulated Windows gateway will be skipped.
  - Network scanning on IoT Edge 1.4 LTS EFLOW using OPC Discovery is not supported yet. This applies to the deployed [simulation environment](./web-api/readme.md#getting-started) and engineering tool. You can register servers using a discovery url using the [registry service's registration REST API](./web-api/api.md).

### Changes in 2.8.4

- Updated .net to .net 6.0 LTS from .net core 3.1 LTS which will be going out of support on 12/13/2022.

## Azure Industrial IoT Platform Release 2.8

We are pleased to announce the release of version 2.8 of our Industrial IoT Platform as well as the declaration of Long-Term Support (LTS) for this version.
While we continue to develop and release updates to our ongoing projects on GitHub, we now also offer a branch that will only get critical bug fixes and security updates starting in July 2021. Customers can rely upon a longer-term support lifecycle for these LTS builds, providing stability and assurance for the planning on longer time horizons our customers require. The LTS branch offers customers a guarantee that they will benefit from any necessary security or critical bug fixes with minimal impact to their deployments and module interactions. At the same time, customers can access the latest updates in the main branch to keep pace with the latest developments and fastest cycle time for product updates.

> IMPORTANT: We suggest to update from the version 2.6 or later to ensure secure operations of your deployment. 2.8.0 is not backwards compatible with version 2.5.x

Version 2.8.0 includes an updated version of the IoT Edge Runtime, a new Linux base image for all Linux deployments, and several bug fixes. The detailed changes can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/Industrial-IoT/releases/tag/2.8.0).
