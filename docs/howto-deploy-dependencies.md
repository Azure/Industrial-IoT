# Deploying Dependencies for local Development

This article explains how to deploy only the Azure Platform Microservices need to do local development and debugging.   At the end you will have a resource group deployed that contains everything you need for local development and debugging.

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Note: Due the dependency on the AzureRM module, deployment currently is only supported on Windows.  We will add support for Linux soon.

1. Make sure you have PowerShell and [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-1.1.0) extensions installed.  If not, first install PowerShell, then open PowerShell as Administrator and run

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name AzureRM -AllowClobber
   Install-Module -Name AzureAD -AllowClobber
   ```

2. If you have not done so yet, clone this GitHub repository.  Open a command prompt or terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iiot-components
   cd azure-iiot-components
   ```

## Deploy Azure Platform Microservices

1. Open a command prompt or terminal in the repository root and run:

   ```bash
   deploy -type local
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to assign a name to the resource group for your deployment  The script deploys only the [dependencies](services/dependencies.md) to this resource group in your Azure subscription, but not the Microservices .  The script also registers an Application in Azure Active Directory.  This is needed to support OAUTH based authentication.  Deployment can take several minutes.  In case you run into issues please follow the steps [below](#Troubleshooting-deployment-failures).

3. Once the script completes, you can select to save the .env file.  The .env environment file is the configuration file of all Microservices and tools you want to run on your development machine.  

## Troubleshooting deployment failures

### Resource group name

Ensure you use a short and simple resource group name.  The name is used also to name resources as such it must comply with resource naming requirements.  

### Azure Active Directory (AAD) Registration

The deployment script tries to register AAD applications in Azure Active Directory. Depending on your rights to the selected AAD tenant, this might fail.   There are 3 options:

1. If you chose a AAD tenant from a list of tenants, restart the script and choose a different one from the list.
2. Alternatively, deploy a private AAD tenant, restart the script and select to use it.
3. Continue without Authentication.  Since you are running your Microservices locally, this is acceptable, but does not mimic production environments.  

## Next steps

Now that you have successfully deployed Azure Industrial IoT Microservices to an existing project, here are the suggested next steps:
