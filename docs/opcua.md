# OPC UA

## What is OPC UA?

OPC Unified Architecture (UA), released in 2008, is a platform-independent, service-oriented interoperability standard. OPC UA is used by various industrial systems and devices such as industry PCs, PLCs, and sensors. OPC UA integrates the functionality of the OPC Classic specifications into one extensible framework with built-in security. It is a standard that is driven by the OPC Foundation.

The [OPC Foundation](https://opcfoundation.org/) is a not-for-profit organization with more than 440 members. The goal of the organization is to use OPC specifications to facilitate multi-vendor, multi-platform, secure and reliable interoperability through:

* Infrastructure
* Specifications
* Technology
* Processes

## Why did Microsoft choose OPC UA as Industrial IoT Protocol?

Microsoft chose OPC UA because it is an open, non-proprietary, platform independent, industry-recognized, and proven standard. It is a requirement for Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0) reference architecture solutions ensuring interoperability between a broad set of manufacturing processes and equipment. Microsoft sees demand from its customers to build Industry 4.0 solutions.

Support for OPC UA helps lower the barrier for customers to achieve their goals and provides immediate business value to them.
